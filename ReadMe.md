🛰️ Arecibo Message Generator

This project recreates and extends the Arecibo message, the famous binary radio signal sent into space in 1974 from the Arecibo Observatory.
It allows you to generate both the original (1974) Arecibo message and a modern variant as audio waveforms, and also visualize the message in a grid format.

📖 Background

The Arecibo Message was a 1679-bit binary pattern transmitted at a frequency of 2380 MHz towards the globular star cluster M13.
It was designed by Frank Drake, with help from Carl Sagan and others, as a demonstration of human technological achievement.

Bit 1 was represented as a signal (frequency ON)

Bit 0 was represented as no signal (silence)

When arranged in a 73 × 23 grid, the bits form a pictorial representation showing:

Numbers

DNA structure

Human figure

Solar system

Arecibo telescope

⚡ Features

Generate Modern Arecibo Message (ASK modulation)

0 → 8 kHz tone

1 → 12 kHz tone

Generate Old Arecibo Message (1974 style)

0 → silence

1 → 10 kHz tone

Export as .wav file

Visualize the message as a grid using Matplotlib or Pygame

Adjustable parameters:

Sampling frequency

Bit duration

Carrier frequencies

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Arecibo-Message.git
cd Arecibo-Message

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pygame

🚀 Usage

Run the script:

python arecibo_generator.py

It will ask you:

Choose mode:

1. Modern Arecibo
2. Old Arecibo

Modern Arecibo → generates ASK-based tones with distinct 0/1 frequencies

Old Arecibo → generates the original-style waveform with silence for 0

The resulting .wav file will be saved in the project folder.

📊 Visualization

You can also render the message as a grid:

With Matplotlib:

python arecibo_grid.py

With Pygame:

python arecibo_pygame.py

This shows the familiar binary image of the Arecibo message.

📷 Example Output

(Add screenshots of your generated grid and waveform plots here)

🔮 Future Improvements

Add colored visualization (e.g., map frequencies to colors)

Real-time audio playback instead of saving only

Encode custom binary messages in the Arecibo style

Simulate transmission over noisy channels
